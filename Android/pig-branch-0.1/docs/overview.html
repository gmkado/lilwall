Provides the classes necessary to create programs in the high-level Pig Latin
language and the infrastructure for evaluating these programs. 
<p>
Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets and consists of 2 layers:
Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences of 
Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel implementations already 
exist (e.g., the Hadoop project). Pig's language layer currently consists of 
a textual language called Pig Latin for expressing data analysis programs.
